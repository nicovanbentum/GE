The assimp folder here should only contain the generated `config.h` from the assimp build.

### Linux (tested on Ubuntu 19.04) (**ASSIMP BROKE THE LINUX BUILD, CHECK BACK LATER**)
Use the supplied Makefile. 'cd' to the Raekor directory and perform 'make rebuild' followed by 'make run'.
Requires **SDL2** to be installed by doing `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0` .
