# Build

## Windows
This project relies on [VCPKG](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to build and link the big binaries, make sure it is installed correctly and integrated user-wide.

Clone this repository using
```git clone --recursive https://github.com/nicovanbentum/Raekor.git ```

Next make sure you have the Vulkan SDK installed, you can get the latest version [here](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#sdk/downloadConfirm/latest/windows/vulkan-sdk.exe).

Copy over the ```init.bat``` file in Raekor's main directory to VCPKG's directory and let it do its thing (can take a while to compile Assimp and Bullet3). Once that is done open up the supplied Visual Studio solution (re-target to newest if necessary). ```CTRL+B``` to build, ```CTRL+F5``` to run.

## Linux
Used to work through the supplied makefile, but it's out of date.

# Features
Some experimentals are in place for DirectX 11 and Vulkan. Focus has shifted to getting features in fast in OpenGL so I can use the engine to  research and implement Global Illumination for a research course at the Hogeschool Utrecht. Some of the features currently being worked on:
- [X] Shader hotloading
- [X] Directional & Point lighting
- [X] Shadow mapping (point & directional)
- [X] Normal mapping
- [X] HDR, Gamma & Tone mapping
- [X] Deferred render pipeline
- [ ] PBR Material system
- [X] Screen Space Ambient Occlusion
- [ ] Screen Space Reflections
- [ ] Global Illumination (multiple techniques)
- [ ] Scripting language
- [x] Data driven Entity Component System
