# Raekor Engine

### Windows
Use the supplied Visual Studio Project.

### Linux (tested on Ubuntu 19.04) (**won't build, blame Assimp**)
Use the supplied Makefile. `cd` to the Raekor directory and enter `make rebuild` followed by `make run`.
Requires **SDL2** to be installed by entering `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0` in a terminal.

### Render APIs
Supports both OpenGL and DirectX 11. At any point in time, one's development might be behind on the other.
