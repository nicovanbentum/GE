TODO list and considerations for Raekor:
Drop both GL and DX for Vulkan? 
Vulkan PRO: one API for everything would be easier in the future, maybe runtime API switching isn't the best idea
Vulkan CON: Crazy amount of work to get to the same point I was with the other APIs

Implement deferred rendering?
DFD PRO: significant increase in performance and easier to implement stuff like screen space ambient occlusion
DFD CON: Industry is moving towards Forward+ but it might be more of a learning experience to do DFD first

Implement SSAO.
Implement PHON lighting
Implement Material system (not quite sure what that would look like at this point in time)
Implement Shadow mapping
Implement & explore other shadow options

Write a DDS image format loader (apparently the format is rather easy, just a header followed by the byte chunks for the GPU)

Everything is in order of priority, we should really figure out what we want to do about this render API obstruction.
